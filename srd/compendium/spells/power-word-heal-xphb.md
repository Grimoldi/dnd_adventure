A wave of healing energy washes over one creature you can see within range. The target regains all its [Hit Points](srd/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md). If the creature has the [Charmed](srd/rules/conditions.md#Charmed), [Frightened](srd/rules/conditions.md#Frightened), [Paralyzed](srd/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed), [Poisoned](srd/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned), or [Stunned](srd/rules/conditions.md#Stunned) condition, the condition ends. If the creature has the [Prone](srd/rules/conditions.md#Prone) condition, it can use its [Reaction](srd/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) to stand up.

**Classes**: [Bard](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Cleric](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md)
