# Feign Death
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*3rd-level, Necromancy (ritual)*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action unless cast as a ritual
- **Range:** Touch
- **Components:** V, S, M (a pinch of graveyard dirt)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You touch a willing creature and put it into a cataleptic state that is indistinguishable from death.

For the duration, the target appears dead to outward inspection and to spells used to determine the target's status. The target has the [Blinded](srd/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) and [Incapacitated](srd/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated) conditions, and its [Speed](srd/rules/variant-rules/speed-xphb.md) is 0.

The target also has [Resistance](srd/rules/variant-rules/resistance-xphb.md) to all damage except Psychic damage, and it has [Immunity](srd/rules/variant-rules/immunity-xphb.md) to the [Poisoned](srd/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned) condition.

**Classes**: [Bard (College of Lore)](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Cleric](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md); [Druid](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-druid.md); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
