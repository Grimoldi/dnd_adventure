# Shatter
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*2nd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a chip of mica)
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

A loud noise erupts from a point of your choice within range. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius [Sphere](srd/rules/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered there makes a Constitution saving throw, taking `3d8` Thunder damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. A Construct has [Disadvantage](srd/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on the save.

A nonmagical object that isn't being worn or carried also takes the damage if it's in the spell's area.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The damage increases by `1d8` for each spell slot level above 2.

**Classes**: [Bard (College of Lore)](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Druid (Circle of the Sea)](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-circle-of-the-sea-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Warlock](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock.md); [Wizard (Evoker)](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-evoker-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
