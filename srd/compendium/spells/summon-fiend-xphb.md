# Summon Fiend
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*6th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (a bloody vial worth 600+ GP)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 hour

You call forth a fiendish spirit. It manifests in an unoccupied space that you can see within range and uses the [Fiendish Spirit](srd/compendium/bestiary/fiend/fiendish-spirit-xphb.md) stat block. When you cast the spell, choose Demon, Devil, or Yugoloth. The creature resembles a Fiend of the chosen type, which determines certain details in its stat block. The creature disappears when it drops to 0 [Hit Points](srd/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) or when the spell ends.

The creature is an ally to you and your allies. In combat, the creature shares your [Initiative](srd/rules/variant-rules/initiative-xphb.md) count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It obeys your verbal commands (no action required by you). If you don't issue any, it takes the [Dodge](srd/rules/actions.md#Dodge) action and uses its movement to avoid danger.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Use the spell slot's level for the spell's level in the stat block.

**Classes**: [Bard](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Warlock](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock.md); [Wizard](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
