# Darkness
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*2nd-level, Evocation*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 60 feet
- **Components:** V, M (bat fur and a piece of coal)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

For the duration, magical [Darkness](srd/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md) spreads from a point within range and fills a 15-foot-radius [Sphere](srd/rules/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md). [Darkvision](srd/rules/senses.md#Darkvision) can't see through it, and nonmagical light can't illuminate it.

Alternatively, you cast the spell on an object that isn't being worn or carried, causing the [Darkness](srd/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md) to fill a 15-foot [Emanation](srd/rules/variant-rules/emanation-area-of-effect-xphb.md) originating from that object. Covering that object with something opaque, such as a bowl or helm, blocks the [Darkness](srd/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md).

If any of this spell's area overlaps with an area of [Bright Light](srd/rules/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) or [Dim Light](srd/rules/variant-rules/dim-light-xphb.md) created by a spell of level 2 or lower, that other spell is dispelled.

**Classes**: [Bard (College of Lore)](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-college-of-lore-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Bard](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Fighter (Eldritch Knight)](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-eldritch-knight-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Monk (Warrior of Shadow)](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-warrior-of-shadow-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Rogue (Arcane Trickster)](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-arcane-trickster-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Sorcerer](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-sorcerer.md); [Warlock](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-warlock.md); [Wizard (Evoker)](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-evoker-xphb.md "subclass=XPHB;class=XPHB"); [Wizard](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-wizard.md)
