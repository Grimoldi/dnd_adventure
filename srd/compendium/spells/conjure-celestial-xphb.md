# Conjure Celestial
%%-- Embedded content starts on the next line. --%%
*7th-level, Conjuration*  

- **Casting time:** 1 Action
- **Range:** 90 feet
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 10 minutes

You conjure a spirit from the Upper Planes, which manifests as a pillar of light in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high [Cylinder](srd/rules/variant-rules/cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on a point within range. For each creature you can see in the [Cylinder](srd/rules/variant-rules/cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb.md), choose which of these lights shines on it:

- **Healing Light.** The target regains [Hit Points](srd/rules/variant-rules/hit-points-xphb.md) equal to `4d12` plus your spellcasting ability modifier.  
- **Searing Light.** The target makes a Dexterity saving throw, taking `6d12` Radiant damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.  

Until the spell ends, [Bright Light](srd/rules/variant-rules/bright-light-xphb.md) fills the [Cylinder](srd/rules/variant-rules/cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb.md), and when you move on your turn, you can also move the [Cylinder](srd/rules/variant-rules/cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb.md) up to 30 feet.

Whenever the [Cylinder](srd/rules/variant-rules/cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb.md) moves into the space of a creature you can see and whenever a creature you can see enters the [Cylinder](srd/rules/variant-rules/cylinder-area-of-effect-xphb.md) or ends its turn there, you can bathe it in one of the lights. A creature can be affected by this spell only once per turn.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** The healing and damage increase by `1d12` for each spell slot level above 7.

**Classes**: [Bard](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-bard.md); [Cleric](srd/compendium/lists/list-spells-classes-cleric.md)
