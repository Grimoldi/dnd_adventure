- **Duration:** Instantaneous

Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot-radius [Sphere](srd/rules/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on a point you choose within range. Each creature in the [Sphere](srd/rules/variant-rules/sphere-area-of-effect-xphb.md) makes a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes `12d6` Radiant damage and has the [Blinded](srd/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) condition for 1 minute. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage only.

A creature [Blinded](srd/rules/conditions.md#Blinded) by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

This spell dispels [Darkness](srd/rules/variant-rules/darkness-xphb.md) in its area that was created by any spell.
