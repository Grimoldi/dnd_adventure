***Water Breathing.*** The octopus can breathe only underwater.

## Actions

***Tentacles.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* `+4`, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* 1 Bludgeoning damage.

## Reactions

***Ink Cloud (1/Day).*** Trigger: A creature ends its turn within 5 feet of the octopus while underwater. _Response:_ The octopus releases ink that fills a 5-foot [Cube](srd/rules/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) centered on itself, and the octopus moves up to its [Swim Speed](srd/rules/variant-rules/swim-speed-xphb.md). The [Cube](srd/rules/variant-rules/cube-area-of-effect-xphb.md) is [Heavily Obscured](srd/rules/variant-rules/heavily-obscured-xphb.md) for 1 minute or until a strong current or similar effect disperses the ink.
