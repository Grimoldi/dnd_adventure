## Traits

***Heated Body (Metal Only).*** A creature that hits the spirit with a melee attack or that starts its turn in a grapple with the spirit takes `1d10` Fire damage.

***Stony Lethargy (Stone Only).*** When a creature starts its turn within 10 feet of the spirit, the spirit can target it with magical energy if the spirit can see it. *Wisdom Saving Throw:* DC equals your spell save DC, the target. *Failure:* Until the start of its next turn, the target can't make [Opportunity Attacks](srd/rules/actions.md#Opportunity%20Attack), and its Speed is halved.

## Actions

***Multiattack.*** The spirit makes a number of Slam attacks equal to half this spell's level (round down).

***Slam.*** *Melee Attack Roll:* Bonus equals your spell attack modifier, reach 5 ft. *Hit:* `1d8 + 4` + the spell's level Bludgeoning damage.

## Reactions

***Berserk Lashing (Clay Only).*** Trigger: The spirit takes damage from a creature. _Response:_ The spirit makes a Slam attack against that creature if possible, or the spirit moves up to half its Speed toward that creature without provoking [Opportunity Attacks](srd/rules/actions.md#Opportunity%20Attack).
