You gain the following benefits.

**Instrument Training.** You gain proficiency with three Musical Instruments of your choice.

**Encouraging Song.** As you finish a [Short](srd/rules/variant-rules/short-rest-xphb.md) or [Long Rest](srd/rules/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md), you can play a song on a [Musical Instrument](srd/compendium/items/musical-instrument-xphb.md) with which you have proficiency and give [Heroic Inspiration](srd/rules/variant-rules/heroic-inspiration-xphb.md) to allies who hear the song.
