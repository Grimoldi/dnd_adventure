# Interception
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 209*  

**Prerequisite**: Fighting Style Feature

When a creature you can see hits another creature within 5 feet of you with an attack roll, you can take a [Reaction](srd/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md) to reduce the damage dealt to the target by `1d10` plus your [Proficiency Bonus](srd/rules/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb.md). You must be holding a [Shield](srd/compendium/items/shield-xphb.md) or a Simple or Martial weapon to use this [Reaction](srd/rules/variant-rules/reaction-xphb.md).
