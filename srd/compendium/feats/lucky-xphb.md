*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 201*  

You gain the following benefits.

**Luck Points.** You have a number of Luck Points equal to your [Proficiency Bonus](srd/rules/variant-rules/proficiency-xphb.md) and can spend the points on the benefits below. You regain your expended Luck Points when you finish a [Long Rest](srd/rules/variant-rules/long-rest-xphb.md).

**Advantage.** When you roll a `d20` for a [D20 Test](srd/rules/variant-rules/d20-test-xphb.md), you can spend 1 Luck Point to give yourself [Advantage](srd/rules/variant-rules/advantage-xphb.md) on the roll.

**Disadvantage.** When a creature rolls a `d20` for an attack roll against you, you can spend 1 Luck Point to impose [Disadvantage](srd/rules/variant-rules/disadvantage-xphb.md) on that roll.
