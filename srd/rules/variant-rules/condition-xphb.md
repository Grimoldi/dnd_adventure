# Condition
*Source: Player's Handbook (2024) p. 363. Available in the <span title='Systems Reference Document (5.2)'>SRD</span> and the Free Rules (2024)* 

A condition is a temporary game state. The definition of a condition says how it affects its recipient, and various rules define how to end a condition. This glossary defines these conditions:

- [Blinded](srd/rules/conditions.md#Blinded)  
- [Charmed](srd/rules/conditions.md#Charmed)  
- [Deafened](srd/rules/conditions.md#Deafened)  
- [Exhaustion](srd/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion)  
- [Frightened](srd/rules/conditions.md#Frightened)  
- [Grappled](srd/rules/conditions.md#Grappled)  
- [Incapacitated](srd/rules/conditions.md#Incapacitated)  
- [Invisible](srd/rules/conditions.md#Invisible)  
- [Paralyzed](srd/rules/conditions.md#Paralyzed)  
- [Petrified](srd/rules/conditions.md#Petrified)  
- [Poisoned](srd/rules/conditions.md#Poisoned)  
- [Prone](srd/rules/conditions.md#Prone)  
- [Restrained](srd/rules/conditions.md#Restrained)  
- [Stunned](srd/rules/conditions.md#Stunned)  
- [Unconscious](srd/rules/conditions.md#Unconscious)  

A condition doesn't stack with itself; a recipient either has a condition or doesn't. The [Exhaustion](srd/rules/conditions.md#Exhaustion) condition is an exception to that rule.
